# Fix my code

`Fix my code` is a new type of project, where I’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!Sometimes I know the language, sometimes not.
Please download the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions. The aim isn't to recode everything, just fix it!

## Debug language

* C
* Ruby
* Python
* JavaScript
